## About

I am a fifth year graduate student in mathematics at the [University of Georgia](https://math.uga.edu) in Athens, GA. Previously I was an undergraduate at [Cal Poly](https://math.calpoly.edu) in San Luis Obispo, CA.

Here is my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s9q2d4r7uygy3q9/cv.pdf?dl=0).

## Research

I am interested in algebraic geometry and tropical geometry. My research focuses in particular on intersection theory and birational geometry of moduli spaces of higher-dimensional varieties, and the use of tropical geometry in the study of such moduli spaces. My advisor is [Valery Alexeev](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~valery/).

### Papers

- [*Quasilinear tropical compactifications*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02062), preprint.
- [*Intersection theory of the stable pair compactification of the moduli space of six lines in the plane*](https://rdcu.be/cCiIQ), *European Journal of Mathematics* (2021).
- [*Classically integral quadratic forms excepting at most two values*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01656v1.pdf), with M. Barowsky, W. Damron, A. Mejia, F. Saia, K. Thompson. *Proc. Amer. Math. Soc*. 146 (2018), 3661-3677.
