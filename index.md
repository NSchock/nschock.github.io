## About

I am a second year graduate student in mathematics at the University of Georgia. I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, in 2017.

## Research

I am broadly interested in algebraic geometry.

In the summer of 2016, I participated in the [WADE Into Research](http://college.wfu.edu/mathreu/) REU at Wake Forest University
