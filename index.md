## About

I am a third year graduate student in mathematics at the University of Georgia. I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, in 2017.

## Research

I am interested in algebraic geometry, in particular compactifications of moduli spaces and enumerative geometry. My advisor is [Valery Alexeev](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~valery/)

### Papers

- [*Classically integral quadratic forms excepting at most two values*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01656v1.pdf), with M. Barowsky, W. Damron, A. Mejia, F. Saia, K. Thompson. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 146 (2018), 3661-3677.
