## About

I am a Ph.D. student in my 5th year at the university of Georgia.

## Research

I am interested in algebraic geometry and tropical geometry. The main focus of my research is the study of the geometry of moduli of higher-dimensional varieties, in particular their intersection theory and birational geometry. My advisor is [Valery Alexeev](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~valery/).

### Papers

- *Quasilinear tropical compactifications*, in progress.
- [*Intersection theory of the stable pair compactification of the moduli space of six lines in the plane*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06056.pdf), accepted, *European Journal of Mathematics*.
- [*Classically integral quadratic forms excepting at most two values*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01656v1.pdf), with M. Barowsky, W. Damron, A. Mejia, F. Saia, K. Thompson. *Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.* 146 (2018), 3661-3677.
